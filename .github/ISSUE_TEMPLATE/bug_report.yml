        **Before You Start...**

        This form is only for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        Prerequisites

        - Node.js >= 18.18.0
        - Git

        - Read the [docs](https://rolldown.rs/)
        # - Ask on [Discord Chat](https://chat.rolldown.rs)
        - Ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/discussions)

        Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.
        However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version,
        you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.

        What do we need to do after opening your repro in order to make the bug happen?

Note that you can use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to format lists and code.
