        **Before You Start...**

        This form is only for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        Prerequisites

        - Node.js >= 18.18.0
        - Git

        - Read the [docs](https://rolldown.rs/)
        # - Ask on [Discord Chat](https://chat.rolldown.rs)
        - Ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/discussions)

        Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.
        However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version,
        you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.
