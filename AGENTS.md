# Project Identity

Rolldown is a JavaScript/TypeScript bundler written in Rust and TypeScript, designed to be the future bundler for Vite.

<tips>

- You are an expert Rust, JavaScript and TypeScript developer.
- Rolldown's performance is critical for developers and tools built on top of it. As such, it is critical to aim for best possible performance when optimizing Rolldown.

# Architecture

## Three-Layer Architecture

```
TypeScript API (/packages/rolldown)
       ↓
NAPI Bindings (crates/rolldown_binding)
       ↓
Rust Core (crates/rolldown)
```

# Repository Structure

- **This is a hybrid Rust and Node.js monorepo** managed with `pnpm` and `cargo`.
- `crates/`: All Rust crates, including the core bundler, NAPI bindings, and builtin plugins.
- `crates/rolldown`: The Rust core, implementing the bundler logic.
- `crates/rolldown/tests`: Integration tests for the Rust core.
- `crates/rolldown_binding`: Defines NAPI bindings to expose Rust functionality to Node.js.
- `crates/rolldown_plugin`: Defines the plugin interface for writing plugins in Rust.
- `crates/rolldown_plugin_*`: All builtin plugins implemented in Rust.
- `packages/`: All Node.js packages, including the main `rolldown` package.
- `packages/rolldown`: The main Node.js package exposing the TypeScript API.
- `packages/rolldown-tests`: Test suite for the `rolldown` package using Vitest.
- `packages/rollup-tests`: Compatibility test suite for Rollup plugins.
- `docs/`: Documentation site built with VitePress.

## Auto-generated or Submodule Files

MANDATORY: NEVER edit these files directly.

- `packages/rolldown/src/binding.js` - Based on `crates/rolldown_binding`, auto-generated by `just build-rolldown`
- `packages/rolldown/src/binding.d.ts` - Based on `crates/rolldown_binding`, auto-generated by `just build-rolldown`
- `rollup/*` - Git submodule for test fixtures

# Bash commands

IMPORTANT: The project uses `just` as a task runner. Always prefer `just` commands over direct `npm` or `cargo` commands. Run `just --list` before using `npm` or `cargo` directly.

- `just roll` - Builds, lints, and tests everything (Rust + Node.js + repo)
- `just build-rolldown` - Builds the `rolldown` node package, its dependencies and binding binary.
- `just lint` - Lints everything (Rust + Node.js + repo)
- `just lint-rust` - Performs Rust related linting
- `just lint-node` - Performs Node.js related linting
- `just lint-repo` - Performs repository related linting
- `just test` - Tests everything (Rust + Node.js)
- `just test-rust` - Tests Rust crates. Snapshots will be updated automatically if needed.
- `just test-node` - Tests Node.js packages
- `just fix` - Auto-fixes what can be fixed (Rust + Node.js + repo)
- `just fix-rust` - Auto-fixes Rust issues
- `just fix-node` - Auto-fixes Node.js issues
- `just fix-repo` - Auto-fixes repository issues

# Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Check surrounding code for conventions:** Before adding new code, always study the existing patterns, naming conventions, and architectural choices in the file and directory you are working in.
- **Break large changes into tracked steps:** Decompose substantial work into manageable subtasks. Track progress to prevent scope creep and missed items. Use `TodoWrite` or similar tools to maintain a checklist.
- **Batch multiple edits:** Prefer to batch multiple edits over sequential single edits. Use `MultiEdit` or similar tools if available.
