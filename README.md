# Rolldown

Rolldown is a JavaScript bundler written in Rust intended to serve as the future bundler used in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It provides Rollup-compatible APIs and plugin interface, but will be more similar to esbuild in scope.

For more information, please check out the documentation at [rolldown.rs](https://rolldown.rs/about).

# Contributing

# Credits

The Rolldown project is heavily inspired by:

- [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild), created by [Evan Wallace](https://github.com/evanw).

And supported by:

- [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) for Node.js add-ons in Rust via Node-API.
- [oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) for the underlying parser and resolver.
- [@parcel/sourcemap](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/source-map).
