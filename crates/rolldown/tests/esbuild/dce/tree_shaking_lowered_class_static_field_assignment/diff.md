1. seems esbuild mark static field as side effects whatever, should investigate

### esbuild
```js
// entry.ts
var KeepMe1 = class {
};
KeepMe1.x = "x";
KeepMe1.y = "y";
KeepMe1.z = "z";
var KeepMe2 = class {

var KeepMe3 = class {

KeepMe3.x = "x";
KeepMe3.y = "y";
KeepMe3.z = "z";
new KeepMe3();
```
### rolldown
```js

//#region entry.ts
