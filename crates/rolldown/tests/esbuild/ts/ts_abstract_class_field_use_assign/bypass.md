# Reason
1. rolldown get the code after transpiled, there is no way to get `abstract` annotation,
also it generate the same code as `webpack`, so treated it as passed
# Diff
## /out.js
### esbuild
```js
const keepThis = Symbol("keepThis");
keepThis;
class Foo {
}
(() => new Foo())();
```
### rolldown
```js

//#region entry.ts
const keepThis = Symbol("keepThis");
var Foo = class {
	REMOVE_THIS;
	[keepThis];
};
(() => new Foo())();

//#endregion
