## INVALID_OPTION

```text
[INVALID_OPTION] Error: When "advancedChunks.includeDependenciesRecursively" is set to false, "preserveEntrySignatures" must be set to false or 'allow-extension'. Setting it to 'strict' or 'exports-only' would require changing entry chunk export signatures, which conflicts with strict signature preservation.
