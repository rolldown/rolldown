# Maintenance Guide

A plugin for [rolldown-vite](https://github.com/vitejs/rolldown-vite) that injects a `modulepreload` polyfill for legacy browsers, ported from [Vite's `modulePreloadPolyfillPlugin`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/packages/vite/src/node/plugins/modulePreloadPolyfill.ts#L34).

**This plugin is exclusive to `rolldown-vite` and is currently considered unstable for external use.**

## ðŸ“¦ What it does

This plugin resolves the special import:

```js
import 'vite/modulepreload-polyfill';
```

By default, it injects a polyfill for `rel="modulepreload"` into each entry module, ensuring compatibility with browsers that don't support `modulepreload` natively.

## ðŸš€ Debug Usage

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'rolldown';
import { modulePreloadPolyfillPlugin } from 'rolldown/experimental';

export default defineConfig({
  input: {
    entry: './index.ts',
  },
  plugins: [modulePreloadPolyfillPlugin()],
});
```

## ðŸ§ª Porting Differences

Unlike `Vite`, which uses `__VITE_IS_MODERN__` to control the polyfill, this plugin automatically applies the polyfill only when `output.format` is `esm`, matching `Vite`â€™s behavior.
