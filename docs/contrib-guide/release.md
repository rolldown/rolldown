1. Run `just bump packages [patch|minor|major]` to bump all non-private packages with semantic versioning.

2. Run `git switch -c release-v[version]` to create a new branch for the release.

3. Run `just changelog` to generate the changelog for all packages.

4. Commit these changes with the message: `release: v[version]`.

5. Create PR with targeting the `main` branch.

6. After the PR is merged, run `git switch main` and `git pull`.

7. Checkout the release commit if there are other changes committed to the main branch.

8. Run `git tag v[version]`

9. Run `git push origin refs/tags/v[version]`.

## Canary/Nightly

Canary/Nightly share the same publishing [workflow](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/actions/workflows/release-canary.yml). They are almost the same thing, but with different npm tags.

If you trigger the workflow manually, it will publish the latest commit to the `canary` tag.

If the workflow is triggered by a schedule, it will publish the latest commit to the `nightly` tag.
