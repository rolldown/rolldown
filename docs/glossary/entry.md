# Entry

Entry is an abstract term that represents a collection of multiple concepts. An entry means:

- An entry module used as a starting point for building the module graph
- An entry chunk that's created for exporting the entry module's exports. It will be also used to store the code of the entry module and its dependencies (if not code-split into separate chunks)
