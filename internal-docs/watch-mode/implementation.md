# Watch Mode — Implementation

> The design principles and open questions live in [design.md](./design.md).
> This file is the implementation reference.

## Summary

Watch mode monitors source files and automatically rebuilds when changes are detected. The `rolldown_watcher` crate is the foundation, using a clean actor-based architecture. This doc is the authoritative reference for implementing and evolving watch mode.

## API Contract

### TypeScript API (Rollup-aligned)

```typescript
function watch(input: WatchOptions | WatchOptions[]): RolldownWatcher;
```

- Accepts a single config or an array of configs.
- Each config may have multiple `output` entries. Internally, **each output creates a separate bundler** (a `WatchTask`).
- Returns a `RolldownWatcher` immediately. The first build is deferred to a zero-delay host timer so the caller can attach event listeners first in Node.js and browsers. `WatcherEmitter.close()` is bound through a deferred handler, so a close in the same creation tick waits for asynchronous option/plugin setup instead of becoming a no-op.

```typescript
interface RolldownWatcher {
  on<E extends keyof RolldownWatcherEventMap>(
    event: E,
    listener: (...args: RolldownWatcherEventMap[E]) => MaybePromise<void>,
  ): this;
  off<E extends keyof RolldownWatcherEventMap>(
    event: E,
    listener: (...args: RolldownWatcherEventMap[E]) => MaybePromise<void>,
  ): this;
  clear<E extends keyof RolldownWatcherEventMap>(event: E): void;
  close(): Promise<void>;
}

type RolldownWatcherEventMap = {
  event: [data: RolldownWatcherEvent];
  change: [id: string, change: { event: ChangeEvent }];
  restart: [];
  close: [];
};

type ChangeEvent = 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';

type RolldownWatcherEvent =
  | { code: 'START' }
  | { code: 'BUNDLE_START' }
  | { code: 'BUNDLE_END'; duration: number; output: readonly string[]; result: RolldownWatchBuild }
  | { code: 'END' }
  | { code: 'ERROR'; error: Error; result: RolldownWatchBuild | null };
```

Event listeners are normally **awaited** before proceeding — blocking semantics matching Rollup.
The coordinator may stop waiting for an `event`, `change`, or `restart` listener only when a close
request wins the close-aware dispatch race described below. The JavaScript callback itself keeps
running, and `watcher.close()` still waits for the complete close sequence.

### Rust API

```rust
let watcher = Watcher::new(configs, handler, &watcher_config)?;
watcher.run();       // spawns the coordinator (non-blocking)
watcher.close().await?;  // sends Close, awaits completion
```

Follows the same `new → run → close` pattern as `DevEngine`. `new()` creates the coordinator future but doesn't spawn it. `run()` spawns it on the selected runtime. `close()` first publishes the shared close signal, then calls the idempotent `run()`, sends a fire-and-forget `Close` message, and awaits the shared completion future. The future carries a cloneable terminal close result, so concurrent and later `close()` callers observe the same success or failure. Publishing close before a not-yet-started coordinator prevents a creation-tick close from racing into the initial build. `wait_for_close()` is intentionally completion-only: it keeps Node alive but does not surface the close error through an otherwise ignored promise.

### Known Divergences from Rollup

| Aspect               | Rollup                     | Rolldown               | Reason                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundler per output   | One build, multiple writes | One bundler per output | Architecture constraint — Rolldown's bundler owns the full pipeline |
| `buildStart` calls   | Once per config            | Once per output        | Consequence of one-bundler-per-output                               |
| Module graph sharing | Shared across outputs      | Separate per output    | May change in the future                                            |
| `restart` event      | Per config change          | Per rebuild cycle      | Rolldown emits `restart` once per rebuild cycle                     |

## Architecture

### Actor Pattern

```
Watcher (public API)
  ├── tx: mpsc::Sender ──→ WatchCoordinator (actor, owns everything)
  └── close_notify ──────→ wakes the coordinator while it awaits a consumer callback
                               ├── handler: H (WatcherEventHandler impl)
                               ├── state: WatcherState
                               └── tasks: IndexVec<WatchTaskIdx, WatchTask>
                                    ├── WatchTask 0
                                    │   ├── bundler: Arc<TokioMutex<Bundler>>
                                    │   ├── fs_watcher: DynFsWatcher (owned, per-task)
                                    │   ├── watched_files: FxDashSet<ArcStr>
                                    │   └── needs_rebuild: bool
                                    └── WatchTask N ...

Data flow:
  DynFsWatcher ──(TaskFsEventHandler: maps notify events → FileChangeEvent)──→ WatcherMsg::FileChanges ──→ WatchCoordinator
  WatchCoordinator ──→ dispatch_event / dispatch_change / dispatch_restart
                         └── await_handler_or_close()
                               ├── handler.on_*().await ──→ Consumer (NAPI/Rust)
                               └── close_notify ─────────→ stop the callback wait and run handle_close()
```

**Ownership rules:**

- `Watcher` only holds lifecycle state (`tx`, the close signal, and `coordinator_state`) — lightweight, no bundler access.
- `WatchCoordinator` owns ALL mutable state. No external mutation.
- Each `WatchTask` owns its `DynFsWatcher`. Per-task watchers mean isolated watch sets and simpler ownership.
- Bundler is `Arc<TokioMutex<>>` because event data structs carry a clone for consumer access (e.g. `BUNDLE_END.result`).

## State Machine

```
Idle ──(FsEvent)──→ Debouncing
Debouncing ──(more FsEvents)──→ Debouncing (extend deadline, coalesce changes)
Debouncing ──(timeout)──→ run rebuild sequence → drain buffered → Idle or Debouncing
Any ──(Close)──→ Closing → Closed
```

**No explicit Building state.** The coordinator's event loop blocks during build (it `await`s). Fs events buffer in the mpsc channel. After build, `drain_buffered_events()` via `try_recv()` picks them up.

```rust
enum WatcherState {
    Idle,
    Debouncing { changes: FxIndexMap<String, WatcherChangeKind>, deadline: Instant },
    Closing,
    Closed,
}
```

**Debounce coalescing:** When multiple events arrive for the same path during the debounce window, the change kinds are consolidated rather than using simple last-write-wins. See "Kind Consolidation" below for details. The deadline resets on each new event.

## Debouncing

### Two Layers, One Default

There are two possible debounce layers:

1. **Coordinator-level** (`WatcherState::Debouncing`) — batches file changes across files before triggering a rebuild. Controlled by `buildDelay`. This is the primary mechanism.
2. **Fs-watcher-level** (`notify-debouncer-full`) — deduplicates rapid OS-level events for the same file (e.g. editors that write multiple times per save). Available in `rolldown_fs_watcher` but not used by the watcher.

Only coordinator-level debounce is active by default. This matches Rollup, which implements its own `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` debounce on top of chokidar (chokidar has no debounce option — only `awaitWriteFinish` for write completion detection).

### Rollup's Approach

Rollup's `buildDelay` option (default: **0ms**) controls a simple timer-reset pattern:

```javascript
// Each file change resets the timer
if (this.buildTimeout) clearTimeout(this.buildTimeout);
this.buildTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  // emit all accumulated changes, trigger single rebuild
}, this.buildDelay);
```

Changes accumulate in an `invalidatedIds` Map during the delay window — both per-file deduplication and cross-file batching happen in one mechanism. Rollup also applies an `eventsRewrites` table for smarter coalescing (create+delete=null, delete+create=update, etc.).

### Rolldown's Approach

The `WatcherState::Debouncing` state does the same thing with `tokio::select!` and a deadline reset:

- File change → `Idle` becomes `Debouncing { changes, deadline }`
- More changes → deadline resets, changes accumulate with kind consolidation per path
- Deadline fires → if changes are non-empty, passed to `run_build_sequence()`; if empty (all cancelled out by kind consolidation), silently return to Idle

#### Kind Consolidation

Like Rollup's `eventsRewrites` table, rolldown consolidates change kinds when multiple events arrive for the same path during a debounce window (`merge_change_kind` in `watcher_state.rs`):

| Existing | New    | Result    | Rationale                                                          |
| -------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create   | Update | Create    | File is still new — modification doesn't change that               |
| Create   | Delete | _removed_ | File never existed from the observer's perspective                 |
| Delete   | Create | Update    | File was recreated — net effect is a modification                  |
| _other_  | _any_  | new kind  | Latest kind wins (e.g. Update+Update→Update, Update+Delete→Delete) |

This matters because plugins receive the `WatcherChangeKind` in `watchChange` hooks and may behave differently based on whether a file was created vs. modified.

The fs-watcher layer (`notify-debouncer-full`) is available as an option for users who need OS-level event deduplication (noisy editors, network drives), exposed through `watch.watcher` options (`usePolling` / `pollInterval`). Using both layers adds latency and makes timing harder to reason about, so it's not the default.

### Default Delay

Rollup defaults `buildDelay` to 0ms. The new `rolldown_watcher` defaults to 0ms (`DEFAULT_DEBOUNCE_MS`), matching Rollup.

## Event Lifecycle

### Initial Build

```
Watcher spawns coordinator
  → run_initial_build()
  → on_event(START)
  → per task: on_event(BUNDLE_START) → build → on_event(BUNDLE_END or ERROR)
  → on_event(END)
  → enter event loop (Idle)
```

### File Change → Rebuild

```
File change detected by per-task FsWatcher
  → TaskFsEventHandler sends WatcherMsg::FileChanges
  → process_fs_event():
      - Maps notify EventKind → WatcherChangeKind (Create/Update/Delete)
      - task.invalidate(path) → sets needs_rebuild = true
      - task.call_on_invalidate(path) → fires immediately, before debounce
      - State: Idle → Debouncing, or extends deadline
  → Debounce timer fires (tokio::select!)
  → run_build_sequence(changes):
      1. handler.on_change(path, kind) for each change
      2. task.call_watch_change(path, kind) for each task × each change
      3. handler.on_restart()
      4. handler.on_event(START)
      5. For each task with needs_rebuild:
         a. handler.on_event(BUNDLE_START)
         b. task.build():
            - bundler.with_cached_bundle_experimental(FullBuild, |bundle| { ... })
              1. bundle.scan_modules() → discover module graph
              2. bundle.get_watch_files() → register FS watches (before render, before checking scan result for error recovery)
              3. bundle.bundle_write() or bundle.bundle_generate() (if skip_write)
            - update_watch_files() again with any render-phase files
         c. handler.on_event(BUNDLE_END or ERROR)
      6. handler.on_event(END)
      7. drain_buffered_events() → process events that arrived during build
```

### Close

```
WatchCoordinator::run()
  → polls run_loop() behind AssertUnwindSafe + FutureExt::catch_unwind
  → normal stop, WatcherMsg::Close, callback-interrupted close, and event-loop panic
    all converge on one handle_close() call
  → a caught panic is recorded first; hostile panic payload destruction is contained
  → handle_close():
      1. State → Closing
      2. task.call_hook_close_watcher() for each task (plugin hook, awaited)
         - if no build created a plugin driver, Bundler creates a temporary
           driver for closeWatcher and discards it without closeBundle
         - errors and Rust panics are recorded; remaining tasks still run
      3. task.close() for each task (final BundleHandle close)
         - errors and Rust panics are recorded; remaining tasks still run
      4. handler.on_close() (awaited; a panic is recorded)
      5. State → Closed
      6. coordinator future completes with the aggregated native result
         - event-loop panic and cleanup failures share one stable result
         → close() callers resolve/reject identically
         → wait_for_close() callers resolve as a liveness signal

watcher.close() sets the close flag before starting a not-yet-started coordinator,
starts it if necessary, notifies any in-progress consumer callback wait, sends the
fire-and-forget WatcherMsg::Close, and awaits that shared coordinator future.
```

Consumer callbacks are normally blocking, but the coordinator waits for them together with the
dedicated close signal. If an `event`, `change`, or `restart` listener calls and awaits
`watcher.close()`, the close signal wins the wait and the coordinator drops only its Rust-side wait
for that callback. The JavaScript callback and its promise continue running. The coordinator then
runs the normal close hooks, closes every bundler, and emits `close`; only after that does the
original `watcher.close()` promise resolve. This breaks the self-wait cycle without weakening the
meaning of a resolved close promise.

The JavaScript wrapper has two memoized phases. `nativeClosePromise` awaits
`BindingWatcher.close()` and therefore all Rust hooks/coordinator cleanup.
Regardless of native failure, the outer `closePromise` then awaits every
parallel-plugin worker termination and dispatches `close` listeners
sequentially. Native, worker, and listener failures are aggregated after all
phases have been attempted (a single failure is rethrown unchanged). The native
`close` event callback merely starts/observes this outer lifecycle and returns
immediately, so the Rust coordinator never waits on a listener that waits on
itself. On Node.js, `AsyncLocalStorage` identifies close-listener continuations:
a reentrant `watcher.close()` returns the already-settled native phase, while
outside callers receive the outer promise and therefore observe listener
completion or rejection. Browser hosts do not expose an equivalent async
context. There, the emitter keeps the native-phase fallback active for the
entire close-listener promise so calls after an `await` cannot self-deadlock.
Calls started before listener dispatch still hold the outer promise, but an
unrelated same-watcher call made while the listener is active is
indistinguishable and receives the native phase.

Asynchronous setup failures (for example an `options` hook rejection) are
reported as `ERROR` with `result: null`, followed by `END`, matching Rollup's
pre-build error shape. The emitter is then bound to a terminal close lifecycle,
so a same-tick `close()` cannot remain pending. External close calls are gated
on completion of the terminal report and therefore cannot resolve or dispatch
`close` before `ERROR` and `END` listeners finish. A close called from inside an
`ERROR` or `END` listener starts that same lifecycle but receives a reentrant
nonblocking result, breaking the listener/report self-wait. Close listeners run
only after terminal reporting, so they may await an `END` observation without
forming the inverse wait cycle. Node uses async context to identify those
listener continuations; browser hosts use the same scoped fallback as normal
close-listener reentrancy.

Setup also uses all-settled option initialization and terminates workers from
every successfully initialized output if another output or native watcher
construction fails. Rejected option initialization can also retain
worker-cleanup ownership; the JavaScript setup path adopts those closures
together with fulfilled-option workers and the runtime lease under one
retryable cleanup owner. Cleanup is retried once immediately. If it still
fails, the owner remains in the shared pending-cleanup registry so later
parallel-plugin initialization can recover the workers or lease instead of
discarding them with the setup error. The registry and retry coalescing live in
the platform-neutral `utils/retryable-cleanup.ts`; keeping them separate from
worker startup prevents browser watch builds from retaining Node worker-thread
code.

### Error Recovery

Build errors do **not** stop the watcher. On error, `event('ERROR')` is emitted with the error details and a `result` handle. The watcher continues watching — when the user fixes the error and saves, a rebuild triggers.

## Plugin Hooks

All watch-related hooks are **blocking** — the coordinator awaits their completion. This matches Rollup.

| Hook                         | When                           | Purpose                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `watchChange(id, { event })` | After debounce, before rebuild | Let plugins react to file changes (cache invalidation) |
| `closeWatcher()`             | During watcher close           | Let plugins clean up resources                         |

Plugin context additions in watch mode:

- `this.meta.watchMode` — `true` when running in watch mode
- `this.addWatchFile(id)` — Add a file to the watch set (not in module graph)

### onInvalidate Callback

Configured via `WatcherOptions`, fires **immediately** on file change (before debounce completes). Unlike `watchChange`, this fires per-event, not per-build-cycle.

## File Watching

- After each build, `bundler.watch_files()` returns the current set.
- `WatchTask::update_watch_files()` diffs against the current set — new files are added to the per-task `DynFsWatcher`.
- `include`/`exclude` patterns filter which files are watched (via `pattern_filter`).
- Files are watched **non-recursively** (individual file watches).
- Batch operations: `fs_watcher.paths_mut()` returns a guard for batching adds, committed via `.commit()`.

### Split-Phase Build for Watch Mode

`Bundler::write()` runs scan → render → write atomically. But the watcher needs to register FS watches for discovered files BETWEEN scan and write — otherwise changes made during render hooks (e.g. `renderStart` modifying a file) are missed because the FS watcher isn't watching yet.

The watcher uses `Bundler::with_cached_bundle_experimental()` to get `&mut Bundle` access, allowing manual orchestration of the build phases:

1. **Scan** — `bundle.scan_modules()` discovers module graph and populates watch files
2. **Watch registration** — `bundle.get_watch_files()` → register FS watches BEFORE render hooks fire.
   This happens before checking the scan result — so files are watched even on scan error.
   This is critical for error recovery: if a user introduces a syntax error, the watcher must
   still be watching the broken file so that saving a fix triggers a rebuild.
3. **Write/Generate** — `bundle_write()` or `bundle_generate()` (if `skip_write`)

This matches the legacy watcher's approach (`with_cached_bundle`), where `watch_files()` was called between scan and write phases.

### Missing File Recovery

When an import resolves to a non-existent file, the build errors. Watch mode relies on the resolver cache being cleared before each rebuild (`bundler.clear_resolver_cache()`). The expected recovery workflow is: create the missing file, then manually edit a watched file (e.g. noop edit to the importer) to trigger a rebuild. The resolver re-evaluates the import with a fresh cache and succeeds. This matches Rollup's behavior — Rollup only watches successfully loaded modules.

### Notify Event Mapping

```
notify::EventKind::Create(_)                              → WatcherChangeKind::Create
notify::EventKind::Modify(Name(RenameMode::To))           → WatcherChangeKind::Create
notify::EventKind::Modify(Name(RenameMode::Both))         → per-path (see below)
notify::EventKind::Modify(Name(RenameMode::From))         → WatcherChangeKind::Delete
notify::EventKind::Remove(_)                              → WatcherChangeKind::Delete
notify::EventKind::Modify(_)  (other)                     → WatcherChangeKind::Update
notify::EventKind::Access(_)                              → None (ignored — prevents infinite rebuild loops on Linux)
```

**Rename handling:** Linux inotify can emit `Modify(Name(Both))` when both source and destination are known in a single rename event. This event carries two paths `[from, to]`. The event handler splits it into two `FileChangeEvent`s: `Delete` for the source path and `Create` for the destination path. This preserves both signals — the delete ensures stale cache entries are invalidated, and the create triggers missing-dir rebuilds. `RenameMode::To` and `RenameMode::From` are the single-path equivalents.

**Access filtering:** The build process reads watched source files, which on Linux triggers `IN_OPEN`/`IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE` events. Without filtering, these cause infinite rebuild loops.

### Path Identity

The watch set stores paths as raw `ArcStr` strings. The `notify` crate reports events with OS-native paths. If these don't match exactly, `is_watched_file()` fails silently. The current `#[cfg(windows)]` backslash fallback is a symptom.

**Recommendation:** Use `PathBuf` for the watched file set instead of `ArcStr`. This handles trailing slashes, double separators, `.` segments, and Windows `\` vs `/` — all common mismatch sources between resolver output and notify events.

See [module-id.md](../module-id/implementation.md) for the full analysis of path identity across the bundler, `PathBuf` comparison behavior, and Rollup's approach.

## WatcherEventHandler Trait

The single extension point for consumers. NAPI implements it to bridge to JS; Rust consumers implement directly.

```rust
pub trait WatcherEventHandler: Send + Sync {
    fn on_event(&self, event: WatchEvent) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + Send;
    fn on_change(&self, path: &str, kind: WatcherChangeKind) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + Send;
    fn on_restart(&self) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + Send;
    fn on_close(&self) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + Send;
}
```

All methods are awaited during normal operation, ensuring Rollup-compatible sequential semantics.
The `on_event`, `on_change`, and `on_restart` waits are close-aware so an awaited listener can close
its own watcher without deadlocking. `on_close` remains fully awaited as part of the close sequence.

## NAPI Bridge

### Event Handler

`NapiWatcherEventHandler` implements `WatcherEventHandler`, bridging all 4 trait methods to a single JS callback via `ThreadsafeFunction`. Each method wraps its data in a `BindingWatcherEvent` variant and calls `listener.await_call()`, which awaits the JS Promise. During normal dispatch the coordinator therefore blocks until the JS handlers finish; if the close signal wins, the close-aware dispatch wrapper drops only this Rust-side wait as described above.

```rust
struct NapiWatcherEventHandler {
    listener: Arc<MaybeAsyncJsCallback<FnArgs<(BindingWatcherEvent,)>>>,
}

impl WatcherEventHandler for NapiWatcherEventHandler {
    async fn on_event(&self, event: WatchEvent) {
        let binding_event = BindingWatcherEvent::from_watch_event(event);
        self.listener.await_call(FnArgs { data: (binding_event,) }).await;
    }
    // same pattern for on_change (from_change), on_restart, on_close
}
```

`BindingWatcherEvent` wraps an internal enum (`BundleEvent | Change | Restart | Close`) with NAPI-exposed accessor methods (`eventKind()`, `bundleEventKind()`, `bundleEndData()`, etc.) for JS consumption.

### Event Loop Keepalive

`ThreadsafeFunction` uses `Weak = true` (unref'd), so it doesn't prevent Node.js from exiting. The coordinator is a `Shared<Future>` carrying the terminal native close result. `Watcher::close()` replays that result, while `Watcher::wait_for_close()` deliberately discards it and resolves when the coordinator finishes. The NAPI binding exposes the latter as `waitForClose()` — the pending JS Promise keeps the event loop alive without creating an unhandled rejection. This replaces the old `setInterval(() => {}, 1e9)` hack.

```
constructor(options, listener)  // creates Watcher with handler, ready to run
run()   → inner.run()           // spawns coordinator (non-blocking)
        → inner.waitForClose()  // pending Promise keeps Node alive
close() → inner.close()         // sends Close msg, awaits shared future
                                // waitForClose() resolves, event loop free to exit
```

### Binding as Thin Wrapper

`BindingWatcher` is intentionally a thin wrapper — it holds a `rolldown_watcher::Watcher` and delegates directly. No state machine, no locking, no logic beyond type conversion. All lifecycle management lives in the Rust core. The constructor takes both `options` and `listener`, creates the `NapiWatcherEventHandler`, and passes it to `Watcher::new()`. Each NAPI method (`run`, `waitForClose`, `close`) is a direct delegation to the inner watcher.

### Event Emitter

`WatcherEmitter` uses a simple `Map<string, Function[]>` for listener storage (on/off). Async `emit()` dispatches handlers sequentially (`for...of` + `await`) so side effects from earlier handlers (e.g. `result.close()` triggering `closeBundle`) are visible to later handlers. It also owns a deferred close-handler Promise so `close()` is valid before `createWatcher()` finishes asynchronous plugin setup. The bound `Watcher` remains the authority for native/full-phase memoization. Close-listener reentrancy uses `AsyncLocalStorage` on Node.js and a per-emitter active-listener fallback in browser builds; the browser fallback intentionally prioritizes no deadlock over distinguishing unrelated calls during the listener promise. No external dependency is needed.

Setup failures are reported as `ERROR` then `END` before an external same-tick
`close()` can finish. Errors from another JavaScript realm retain their original
object identity; non-Error thrown values are wrapped with `cause`, including a
non-coercible fallback that cannot disrupt terminal reporting.

### Event Mapping

Lives in `watcher.ts` (`createEventCallback()` — a standalone function), not in the emitter. The callback is created before the `BindingWatcher` constructor and passed to it alongside options. Maps `BindingWatcherEvent` → Rollup-compatible event objects. Error events carry structured `Vec<BuildDiagnostic>` data from Rust; the binding preserves these diagnostics, and the JS layer converts them via `aggregateBindingErrorsIntoJsError()` before exposing them on Rollup-style event objects.

### End-to-End Flow

```
WatchCoordinator.run_build_sequence()
  → dispatch_event(WatchEvent::BundleEnd(data))
    → await_handler_or_close(handler.on_event(...))
      ├── callback branch:
      │     → NapiWatcherEventHandler.on_event()
      │       → BindingWatcherEvent::from_watch_event(event)
      │       → listener.await_call(binding_event).await → ThreadsafeFunction calls JS
      │     → JS: createEventCallback() receives BindingWatcherEvent
      │       → Maps to RolldownWatcherEvent { code: 'BUNDLE_END', ... }
      │       → emitter.emit('event', mapped_event) → sequential for...of await
      │     → await_call resolves → coordinator continues
      └── close branch:
            → close_notify resolves → dispatch returns close requested
            → coordinator runs handle_close() and completes the close sequence
```

## Configuration

```typescript
interface WatcherOptions {
  skipWrite?: boolean; // Skip bundle.write(). Default: false
  buildDelay?: number; // Debounce ms. Default: 0
  watcher?: {
    usePolling?: boolean; // Use polling backend. Default: false
    pollInterval?: number; // Polling interval ms. Default: 100
  };
  notify?: { ... }; // Deprecated — use `watcher` instead
  include?: StringOrRegExp | StringOrRegExp[];
  exclude?: StringOrRegExp | StringOrRegExp[];
  onInvalidate?: (id: string) => void;
  clearScreen?: boolean; // Clear screen on rebuild. Default: true
}
```

Environment variables set during watch mode:

```
ROLLUP_WATCH=true    // Rollup compatibility
ROLLDOWN_WATCH=true  // Rolldown-specific
```

## Migration Status

Tracks progress from old watcher → new `rolldown_watcher`. Items link to [#6482](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/6482) and related issues.

### NAPI + TypeScript Bridge

- [x] Surface setup errors (e.g. `options` hook) as `ERROR` events with `result: null`, then `END`, without leaking partially initialized parallel-plugin workers ([#6482](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/6482))

### Cleanup

- [ ] Remove `reset_closed_for_watch_mode()` hack — see [rust-bundler.md](../rust-bundler/implementation.md) for the `Bundle.close()` design that replaces it
- [ ] Rename `WatcherChangeKind` → `FileChangeEventKind` (type stays in `rolldown_common`)
- [ ] CLI `--watch` mode working with new watcher ([#7759](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/7759))

### Missing Features

- [x] Resolver cache invalidation between rebuilds ([#6482](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/6482)) — `clear_resolver_cache()` called at start of each rebuild
- [ ] File unwatching — `update_watch_files()` only adds, never removes. Watch set grows monotonically

### Future

- [ ] Non-blocking builds — spawn builds instead of inline `await` (see Unresolved Questions)
- [ ] Incremental builds — `WatchTask::build()` currently does full rebuild via `bundler.write()`
- [ ] Parallel task builds within a single coordinator
- [ ] Bulk-change threshold optimization — For bulk changes (e.g. `git checkout` producing 1000+ file events), we could skip per-file `on_change`/`watchChange` hooks and just do a full rebuild. Rollup doesn't do this — it always calls per-file hooks regardless of volume. This is a potential future optimization if per-file hook overhead becomes a performance issue.
