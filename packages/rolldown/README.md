# Rolldown

> Fast Rust-based bundler for JavaScript with Rollup-compatible API

- ⚡️ Lightning Fast Performance
- 🔌 Rollup-Compatible APIs
- ⏩ esbuild Feature Parity

Rolldown is primarily designed to serve as the underlying bundler in [Vite](https://vite.dev/), with the goal to replace esbuild and Rollup with one unified build tool. Although designed for Vite, Rolldown is also fully capable of being used as a standalone, general-purpose bundler. It can serve as a drop-in replacement for Rollup in most cases, and can also be used as an esbuild alternative when better chunking control is needed.
