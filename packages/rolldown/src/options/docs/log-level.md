The default logLevel of "info" means that info and warnings logs will be processed while debug logs will be swallowed, which means that they are neither passed to plugin [`onLog`](/reference/Interface.Plugin#onlog) hooks nor the [`onLog`](/reference/InputOptions.onLog) option or printed to the console.
